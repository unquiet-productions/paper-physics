# Paper Physics

1. How the Game Works

    Paper Physics is a physics sandbox where everything is made of paper. There is 2 game modes: the Task Mode, and the Sandbox Mode. In the task mode, you complete a series of tasks and puzzles, and in order to complete a task and unlock the next one, you have to collect at least 2 stars from the previous level. Along the way, you unlock many different items and objects you can use in the Sandbox Mode. In the Sandbox Mode, you can do whatever you want in your workspace - a piece of paper. 
You can place objects using the + buttons and they will appear at your plus sign, or you can use the keys on your keyboard to place objects at your mouse. You can also pan around your workspace using the middle mouse button (in the future, you will be able to zoom in and out using the middle mouse button). You can set the starting rotation of the objects you spawn by pressing R, and the rotation will be shown by the plus sign. If you want to restart your task or drawing, click the X button in the taskbar. You can manipulate time using the 3 buttons in the task bar. You can go back to the main menu using the "Back" button in the task bar.
(Future add-ons: Saving your drawings, renaming them, etc.)
